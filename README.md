## Installation

vim-mediawiki-editor requires Vim compiled with python support and the [python `mwclient` library](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient).

You likely have Python support, but you can check with `vim --version | grep +python`. MacVim comes with Python support.

If you get an error, try `pip install mwclient` to get the library.

Once you have these, use your favorite Vim plugin manager to install `aquach/vim-mediawiki-editor`, or copy `plugin` and `doc` into your `.vim` folder.

I recommend pairing this plugin with [mediawiki.vim](https://github.com/chikamichi/mediawiki.vim) for syntax highlighting and with [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) for WriteRoom-esque editing.

## Usage

### Mappings

vim-mediawiki-editor has a few default bindings. They should probably change 
to something smarter.

`gf` navigates to the wikilink under your cursor.

`C-w f` opens the wikilink under your cursor in a new window.

`gl` opens the backlinks for the wikilink under your cursor.

`g.` opens the backlinks for the article you are on.

### Commands

vim-mediawiki-editor offers these commands:

#### :MWRead <article-name>

Loads the given article into a new buffer.

```
:MWRead Radish
```

#### :MWMove <article-name> or :MWMoveNoRedirect <article-name>

MWMove does a normal move with redirect.

MWMoveNoRedirect renames the page with no redirect.

#### :MWBacklinks [article-name]

Opens a list of things that link to the given article, which you can `gf`, 
`C-w f`, or hit Enter on to open.

#### :MWWrite [article-name]

Writes the article back to the site. If you don't specify an article name, it defaults to the article you opened with `:MWRead`. After prompting you for the edit summary and major/minor edit, it will publish your work back to the site.

#### :MWDiff [article-name]

Diffs the current buffer against the hosted version of the article specified on the site. If you don't specify an article name, it defaults to the article you currently have open with `:MWRead`.

#### :MWSearch [query]

Searches for pages matching [query] and displays a title list that you can 
`gf`, `C-w f`, or hit Enter on.

#### :MWSubpages [article-name]

Displays a list of subpages of the given article (or the article you are 
on) which you can `gf` on to navigate to.

#### :MWBrowse [article-name]

Views the article specified in your configured browser. If you don't specify an article name, it defaults to the article you currently have open with `:MWRead`.

## Configuration

If you don't specify these settings, vim-mediawiki-editor will prompt you when you first run a vim-mediawiki-editor command.

#### g:mediawiki_editor_url

The URL of the site you're editing. For the English wikipedia, that'd be `en.wikipedia.org`.

#### g:mediawiki_editor_path

The MediaWiki [script path](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgScriptPath).
For the wikipedias and other WMF wikis, this is `/w/`, but for other wikis it can be `/`, `/wiki/`,
or some other value.

#### g:mediawiki_editor_domain

The domain name for authentication. Used by [some auth extensions](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/wiki/Site.login#parameters). This is optional, so it won't be prompted for by Vim. You need to put it in your `.vimrc` if you want to use it.

#### g:mediawiki_editor_username

Your account username.

#### g:mediawiki_editor_password

Your account password. I recommend putting the URL and username in your `.vimrc` and letting Vim ask for your password.

#### g:mediawiki_basicauth_enabled

Set this to `on` to enable HTTP Basic Authentication.

#### g:mediawiki_basicauth_username

The HTTP Basic Auth Username. Will be prompted if not provided and basic `g:mediawiki_basicauth_enabled` is on.

#### g:mediawiki_basicauth_password

The HTTP Basic Auth Password. Will be prompted if not provided and basic `g:mediawiki_basicauth_enabled` is on.

#### g:mediawiki_search_scope ####

Search scope: ‘text’ for fulltext, or ‘title’ for titles only. Depending
on the search backend, both options may not be available. For instance
CirrusSearch doesn’t support ‘title’, but instead provides an “intitle:”
query string filter.

Default : title

## Testing

See the current integration test for `mwclient` in the `tests` directory. It tests for Python 2 and 3 compatibility as well as across versions of `mwclient`.
